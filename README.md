# PMP SMPC

This repository is a software implementation of a parallel algorithm of SMPC using partial minimization problem (PMP).

## Usage

To use this software, run the `main.m` file.

## Configuration

Simulation settings are stored in the `config` directory. To change the configuration:

1. Add a new file to the `config` directory with your desired settings.
2. Specify the new configuration file in the `main.m` file.

## Results

Simulation results are saved in the `result` directory.

## Performance Analysis

To view computation times, you can use the provided script `./data/showTimeData.m`. 
Alternatively, you are welcome to modify the software to analyze performance data according to your specific needs.
